This repository contains two shell scripts designed to streamline the installation and management of command-line tools and their dependencies.

    Dependency Copier Script: This script identifies and copies specified commands along with their dependencies from your system to a designated directory. It ensures that all necessary files are gathered for offline use.

    Installer Script: This script facilitates the installation of the copied commands and their dependencies on your system. Once you have initially downloaded the required files from the internet, you can use these scripts to set up your environment without needing an internet connection.

By using these scripts, you only need to perform a one-time download of the necessary files. Subsequent installations can be carried out entirely offline, enhancing convenience and efficiency.
